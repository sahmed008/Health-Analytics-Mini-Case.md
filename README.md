# Health-Analytics-Mini-Case

We’ve just received an urgent request from the General Manager of Analytics at Health Co requesting our assistance with their analysis of the `health.user_logs` dataset.
The Health Co analytics team have shared with us their SQL script - they unfortunately ran into a few bugs that they couldn’t fix!
We’ve been asked to quickly debug their SQL script and use the resulting query outputs to quickly answer a few questions that the GM has requested for a board meeting about their active users.
